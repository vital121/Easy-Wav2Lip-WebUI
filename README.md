## Easy-Wav2Lip-WebUI:

## Simple:
* You can run WebUI on google colab or on your own.
* You don't need to read the original repository and figure out the installation, there are 2 files (.bat and .sh) for it
* Google Colab has only one cell to work
* Windows users just need to run one file to work
* Simple documentation to help you
* No more thinking about what is responsible for what

## Fast:
For my test 9 second video in 720p quality and 60fps using Colab Tesla T4:

| Runtime: 6m 53s | Runtime: 56s |

That's not a typo! My clip is shortened from almost 7 minutes to less than 1 minute!

Tracking data is saved between generations of the same video, saving even more time:
